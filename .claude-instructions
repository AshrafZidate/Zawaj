# Claude Code Instructions for Zawaj Project

## Git Commit Policy

**CRITICAL RULE: NEVER commit changes unless explicitly instructed by the user.**

- Do NOT use `git commit` unless the user says "commit" or "commit these changes"
- Do NOT proactively commit after completing tasks
- Always wait for explicit user confirmation before committing
- Use `git status` and `git diff` to show changes, but don't commit them
- When in doubt, ASK before committing

## Exception
The only time to commit without asking is if the user explicitly says:
- "Commit this"
- "Commit these changes"
- "Create a commit"
- Similar direct instructions

## Always Remember
User approval is required before any git commit operation.
